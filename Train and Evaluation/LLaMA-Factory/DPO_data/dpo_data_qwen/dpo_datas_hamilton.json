In a directed graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with a directed edge. Given a graph, you need to output Yes or No, indicating whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph. Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0->2) (0->1) (0->4) (1->3) (1->2) (2->3) (2->4) (3->4). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?"}], "rejected": {"from": "gpt", "value": "import re\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Graph description\ngraph = \"The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0->2) (0->1) (0->4) (1->3) (1->2) (2->3) (2->4) (3->4).\"\n\n# Regular expression to extract directed edges\npattern = r'\\((\\d+)->(\\d+)\\)'\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, graph)\n\n# Create a directed graph\nG = nx.DiGraph()\n\n# Add edges to the graph\nfor node1, node2 in matches:\n    G.add_edge(int(node1), int(node2))\n\n# Check for Hamiltonian path\nhas_hamiltonian_path = nx.is_tournament(G) or nx.is_dag(G) or nx.tournament.has_hamiltonian_path(G)\nprint(\"Yes\" if has_hamiltonian_path else \"No\")\n```\uf947\n"}, "chosen": {"from": "gpt", "value": "import re\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Graph description\ngraph = \"The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0->2) (0->1) (0->4) (1->3) (1->2) (2->3) (2->4) (3->4).\"\n\n# Regular expression to extract directed edges\npattern = r'\\((\\d+)->(\\d+)\\)'\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, graph)\n\n# Create a directed graph\nG = nx.DiGraph()\n\n# Add edges to the graph\nfor node1, node2 in matches:\n    G.add_edge(int(node1), int(node2))\n\n# Check for Hamiltonian path\nif nx.is_tournament(G):\n    path = nx.tournament.hamiltonian_path(G)\n    print(\"Hamiltonian path:\", path)\nelse:\n    print(\"No Hamiltonian path in the directed graph.\")\n\n"}}]
