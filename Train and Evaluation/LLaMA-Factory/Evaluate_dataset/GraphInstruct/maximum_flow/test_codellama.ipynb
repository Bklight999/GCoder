Given a directed graph with capacities assigned to its edges, the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source to the sink, respecting the capacity constraints on each edge. The goal is to find the optimal way to route flow through the network to maximize the flow from source to sink.', 'answer': 6}\n"

      "Calculate the minimum cut between node 11 and node 6 in this graph. Given a directed graph with capacities assigned to its edges, the minimum cut from a source node to a sink node is the minimum amount of flow that must be sent from the source to the sink, respecting the capacity constraints on each edge. The goal is to find the optimal way to route flow through the network to minimize the flow from source to sink. [/INST]\n",

      "Calculate the maximum flow between node 0 and node 4 in this graph. Given a directed graph with capacities assigned to its edges, the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source to the sink, respecting the capacity constraints on each edge. The goal is to find the optimal way to route flow through the network to maximize the flow from source to sink. [/INST]\n",

      "### Instruction:\n",
      "Write a function that takes a string and returns a string with the letters of the string rearranged according to the rules of the Playfair cipher. The Playfair cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by rearranging the alphabet so that the resulting alphabet is a \"square\". The cipher is named after Sir Charles Wheatstone and Sir William Playfair, who published a book on the subject in 1854.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cipher works as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The plaintext is divided into pairs of letters, which are then converted into numbers corresponding to the positions of those letters in the alphabet.\n",
      "2. The numbers are then converted into the coordinates of a point on a grid.\n",
      "3. The points are then converted into the coordinates of the upper-left-most point of a rectangle on the grid which contains the point.\n",
      "4. The rectangle is then converted into the letters of the alphabet corresponding to the letters of the plaintext.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cipher is case-insensitive, so that both 'A' and 'a' are converted to the same number.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cipher is symmetric, so that encrypting a string and then decrypting it will return the original string.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cipher is transposition-based, so that encrypting a string and then decrypting it will return the original string.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cipher is deterministic, so that encrypting the same string twice will return the same ciphertext.\n",

      "#### Description\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a bidirectional water flow stream through a rectangular region. The region is divided into n x m squares. On each square, there is a water storage tank (some filled with water, some empty). The goal is to compute the maximum amount of water that can flow from the source square to the target square.\n",
      "\n",
      "The details of how water moves are as follows. Water first flows downwards (because of gravity, of course), then rightwards, then downwards again, then rightwards, and so on. When the water reaches the bottom-most row of squares, it flows upwards, then leftwards, then upwards, then leftwards, and so on. Any empty square with neighbors (above, below, left, right) that could receive water is considered a \"tile\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The water flow follows these rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initially, each square has 0 bucket of water.\n",
      "2. For each tile, if it has water, it will try to move to the tile above, below, left, or right. If it can move to at least one of these tiles, it will do so, and move the amount of water in it to that tile.\n",
      "3. Once a tile reaches the edge of the grid, it will stop moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of non-negative integers, which represents the amount of water in each square across the entire grid, where the value at each index `grid[i][j]` represents the amount of water in the square `grid[i][j]`, return the amount of water that can be trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally, the amount of water that can be trapped in the grid is the total amount of water above the current level minus the total amount of water below the current level.\n",
